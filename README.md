# Guessing-Game
This project is a simple, interactive "Guess the Number" game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. When the user correctly guesses the number, they are rewarded with a congratulatory message and a reward image displayed in a modal.
